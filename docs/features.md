  - Attachments can be copied to the export directory or referenced in-place
  - Less-compatible images can be converted for even more portable exports:
    - Attachment `HEIC` files convert to `JPEG`
    - Sticker `HEIC` files convert to `PNG`
    - Sticker `HEICS` files convert to `GIF`
  - Attachments are displayed as

  - Sticker effects are annotated in all exports
  - Sticker tapbacks are also supported
- Apple Pay
  - Detects the transaction source, amount, and type
- URL previews
  - Parses the `NSKeyedArchiver` payload to extract preview data

    - Apple Maps (including `Placemark` data)
    - App Store (including app metadata)
    - Rich Collaboration

    - Displayed as embedded `svg` in HTML exports
    - TXT export behavior depends on attachment settings:
      - `disabled`: embedded inline as an `ascii` graphic
      - `compatible, efficient`: saved as an `svg` file
- Duplicated group chats
  - Handles (participants) and chats (threads) can become duplicated
  - On startup:
    - Different handles that belong to the same person are combined
    - Chatrooms that contain identical contacts (i.e., duplicated handles) are combined
