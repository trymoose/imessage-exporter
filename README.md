# imessage-exporter

This crate provides both a library to interact with iMessage data as well as a binary that can perform some useful read-only operations using that data. The aim of this project is to provide the most comprehensive and accurate representation of iMessage data available.

This software can:

- Save, export, backup, and archive iMessage data to open, portable formats
- Preserve multimedia content (images, videos, audio) from conversations
- Facilitate easy migration of message history between devices and platforms
- Run diagnostics on the iMessage database
- Give you full ownership and control over your communication history
- Support compliance with data retention policies or legal requirements
- Run on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Example Export

## Binary

The `imessage-exporter` binary exports iMessage data to `txt` or `html` formats. It can also run diagnostics to find problems with the iMessage database.

Installation instructions for the binary are located [here](imessage-exporter/README.md).

## Library

The `imessage_database` library provides models that allow us to access iMessage information as native data structures.

Documentation for the library is located [here](imessage-database/README.md).
