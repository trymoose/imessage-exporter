/// Reactions to iMessages
///
/// `bp:` GUID prefix for bubble message reactions (links, apps, etc).
///
/// `p:0/` GUID prefix for normal messages (body text, attachments).
///
/// In `p:#/`, the # represents the message index. If a message has 3 attachments:
/// - 0 is the first image
/// - 1 is the second image
/// - 2 is the third image
/// - 3 is the text of the message
///
/// In this example, a Like on `p:2/` is a like on the third image
///
/// Reactions are normal messages in the database, but only the latest reaction
/// is stored. For example:
/// - user receives message -> user likes message
///   - This will create a message and a like message
/// - user receives message -> user likes message -> user unlikes message
///   - This will create a message and a like message
///   - but that like message will get dropped when the unlike message arrives
///   - When messages drop the ROWIDs become non-sequential: the ID of the dropped message row is not reused
///   - This means unliking an old message will make it look like the reaction was applied/removed at the
///     time of latest change; the history of reaction statuses is not kept
