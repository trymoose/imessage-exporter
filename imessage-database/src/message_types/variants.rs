/// # Tapbacks
///
/// [Tapbacks](https://support.apple.com/guide/messages/react-with-tapbacks-icht504f698a/mac) look like normal messages in the database. Only the latest tapback
/// is stored. For example:
///
/// - user receives message -> user likes message
///   - This will create a message and a like message
/// - user receives message -> user likes message -> user unlikes message
///   - This will create a message and a like message
///   - but that like message will get dropped when the unlike message arrives
///   - When messages drop the ROWIDs become non-sequential: the ID of the dropped message row is not reused
///   - This means unliking an old message will make it look like the tapback was applied/removed at the
///     time of latest change; the history of tapback statuses is not kept
///
/// ## Technical detail
///
/// The index specified by the prefix maps to the index of the body part given by [`Message::body()`](crate::tables::messages::Message::body).
///
/// - `bp:` GUID prefix for bubble message tapbacks (url previews, apps, etc).
/// - `p:0/` GUID prefix for normal messages (body text, attachments).
///
/// If a message has 3 attachments followed by some text:
/// - 0 is the first image
/// - 1 is the second image
/// - 2 is the third image
/// - 3 is the text of the message
///
/// In this example, a Like on `p:2/` is a like on the third image.
